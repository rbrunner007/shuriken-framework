# Exploits

## How to write a runnable script

1. Write your script in any language

  - Use the environment variable `TARGET_HOST` to get the correct IP for the team you are targeting 

  - If you're writing Python, you can use [template.py](./template.py) for a boilerplate

  - The environment variables `FLAG_HOST` and `FLAG_PORT` should be used to submit to the scoring server

2. Put the "shebang" line at the top of the file. Here are some examples:

  - Python2: `#!/usr/bin/python`

  - Python3: `#!/usr/bin/python3`

  - Bash: `#!/bin/bash`

3. Rename your script `exploit` with no file extension (e.g. no `.py`)

4. Set the script to executable with `chmod +x exploit`.

5. Put your `exploit` script in a directory. Name the directory to reflect the service you are targeting and what vulnerability you are exploiting. 

  - Your directory structure should now look like this
  '''
exploits/
|
`-- service_vuln/
    |
    `-- exploit
  '''

6. Add, commit, and push to github
'''
git add service_vuln/
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"
git push
'''

## [Template.py](./template.py)

This is a baseline script you can use to make writing your python exploit faster. It has a funciton to automatically submit any flags you capture to the server, as well as pre-set variables which will target the current team your script is being run against.
